                <p><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>Baby Mario and Baby Luigi decided that they wanted to join in on the fun of Mario Party! But since they were too young to participate, they decided to make their own board and play on it with their toys.<br /><br /><strong>Happening Spaces:</strong></p>
                <ul class="bbc_list">
                <li>The 1st Happening Space at the start gives you a Golden Mushroom in case you roll low (only obtainable in the beginning or with really good luck with a Reverse Mushroom).</li>
                <li>The spaces in front of the chest will give you a random coin value between 6 and 12.</li>
                <li>The spaces on top of the chest will give you something based on the character you stand on, from left to right: Luigi will give you a Boo Repellent, Mario will give you a Golden Mushroom, Wario will give you 10 Coins, and Waluigi will give you a Poison Mushroom.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><br /><br /><strong>Map goals:</strong>&nbsp;My goal was to make a Baby Park type of map in Mario Party with the correct aesthetics and feel. An easy map where a lot of chaotic things can happen.<br /><br /><strong>Inspiration:</strong>&nbsp;This board is inspired by my own experiences as a child. I used to make Mario Party boards as a kid for fun with paper and toys I had laying around. I wanted to convey that feeling as much as I could, so I made a small board with huge objects made with child-like drawings. This was a hard map to make look convincing and good at the same time but I think I managed!</p><button class="btn btn-primary" href="#" data-dismiss="modal">

<p><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>What's that across the horizon? I see... Islands? And it seems there's some... things living here. Hopefully they're friendly...<br /><br />This board is modeled after the&nbsp;<em>(usually not great)</em>&nbsp;island-themed boards where the players move from island to island in their pursuit of stars. However, there's more to this board than that! Each of the islands has special attributes and advantages for the player, so based on the flow of the game, you can pick which island to go to and use its unique traits to gain the upper hand. Be careful of the islanders, though, they can be quite mischievous! Each island's special traits will be explained below:<br /><br /><strong>Earth Island:</strong>&nbsp;This is where Mother Nature resides. In this flourished island, the player will be able to obtain a lot of items. The 2 Happening Spaces on this island will allow the player to receive a type of Mushroom as a gift from Mother Nature! Are you in need of items? This is the island to get them!<br /><strong>Water Island:</strong>&nbsp;This is where the spirits of the sea rest. In this peaceful island, the player will be able to amass riches. Every Blue Space on this island has a special effect that gives the player 1 coin for passing over them! The Happening Spaces on this island give the landing player between 1 and 5 coins, but gives all other players between 3 and 7 coins. Are you striving for the Coin Star at the end of the game? This is the place for you!<br /><strong>Fire Island:</strong>&nbsp;This is where the demons of the lava dwell. In this scorching island, the player will be able to amass chaos with the 5 Happening Spaces on this island. The Red Spaces and Bowser Spaces on this island have a special effect that take coins from the current player if they pass over them; 1 for Red Spaces, 2 for Bowser Spaces. The Happening Spaces on this island take 5 coins from every player except the landing player. Are you trying to get that Happening Star at the end of the game? You've come to the right place!<br /><strong>Wind Island:</strong>&nbsp;This is where the Rulers of the Wind have settled. In this gusty island, the played will be able to visit the great Boo to steal from other players. The 3 Happening Spaces on this island warp the player to a different island. The first one along the path will warp the player to Earth Island, the second one will warp the player to Water Island, and the last one will warp the player to Fire Island. At the end of the path, a tornado will blow the player back to the START Space!<br /><br /><strong>Bugs and Glitches:</strong>&nbsp;While not necessarily a glitch, you will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be able to overwrite this board into your game without turning on the "Skip Overwrite Validation" on PartyPlanner64 over in the Settings. This is because the board has 135 Spaces on it, and PartyPlanner64 says that anything over 128 may be unstable. Through testing this myself I have only found out that the only instability issues happen if the player steps over a space that has an index of 129 or higher. I made sure that all the walk-able spaces in the board have an index lower than that, and I've had no issues with the board through testing<br />The glitch of being moved to START when you reverse yourself into a space that is the center of a merge between 2 paths&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;be present in this board. I've not really tested this but since this is a PartyPlanner64 issue, there's nothing I can really do about it. Plus, it's very unlikely for this glitch to happen in board play, as the conditions are very strict.<br /><br /><strong>Final Words:</strong>&nbsp;I will be updating this board eventually for balancing purposes (if necessary) and also aesthetics. If you have any suggestions, do feel free to message me. Also, if you find any glitches or bugs, do report them so I can get them fixed.<br /><br /><strong>Version 3.0 changes:</strong></p>
<ul class="bbc_list">
<li>Earth Island: Changed the location of the first Item Space along the path.</li>
<li>Water Island: Changed the Happening Space event.</li>
<li>Fire Island: Reduced the amount of coins lost from passing over a Bowser Space. Changed the Happening Space event.</li>
<li>Wind Island: No changes.</li>
<li>Bridges: Changed the location of the Chance Time Space on the right bridge.</li>

                <p><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>Star Summit is inspired by the recent release of Star Rod, the new Paper Mario hacking tool. There is no gimmick on this board, just your standard Mario Party 3 board with what I hope are appealing visuals!<br /><br />Textures are all thanks to Star Rod as are most of the objects. A few other models were taken from the Model Resource while the rest were made by hand. Created using SketchUp!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am still figuring out how custom events work. Ideally I would like the Star Spirits to have a random chance of giving two items (Mushroom or Golden Mushroom, Magic Lamp or Lucky Lamp, etc) but I don't know how to set that up yet.</p>

<p><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>Welcome to&nbsp;<span class="bbc_color">Sultan City</span>! Keep your nose clean and your coins close in this town. This board is quite straightforward, and was made to resemble the standard boards as much as possible. It even has a 'shady' district, analogous to the dark area present in some of the standard boards. The background was made using SketchUp. I made the simpler shapes myself and took the textures and character models from the Sketchup Warehouse and Super Mario 64. The inspiration for the board came from a few fun ideas I had for custom events. The custom events included in the final board are:<br /><br /><span class="bbc_color"><br /><strong>Custom Events:</strong><br />Bazaar (board event) - pass by here to sell all your items. The shopkeeper is an honest man and will buy your items for 100% of their market value. If you bring him rare items, he will buy them for 50 coins! The Wacky Watch isn't so terrible now, is it?<br />Goomba's Luxury Lamps - land on goomba's space for a sweet deal: 40 coins for a Magic Lamp! What, you don't have 40 coins? Goomba might be generous enough to make an exception for you. You are buying his lamp no matter what though, so try not to land here with a full inventory!<br />Thief - land on the wrong space in the shady district and you might get robbed! The thieves here always leave a Poison Mushroom as a calling card.<br />Black Market - on the outskirts of town, two Bob-Ombs have set up shop and are selling various items 'procured' by their friends in the shady district. Pay them 10 coins and you might get your 'lost' item back. Or something else entirely!</span><br /><span class="bbc_color"><br /><strong>Issues in current release:</strong><br />After selling your items in the Bazaar, your sold items will not immediately disappear from your character's bar. They will only disappear when somebody opens their item screen or at the beginning of the next turn. This problem is purely visual and does not affect gameplay.<br />Currently, you choose whether or not to visit the bazaar via a path split. This looks a bit clunky and I would much rather have a branching text box, but I haven't managed to make it work yet.<br />The code for the custom events works, but is a bit messy. Mostly because it is a mish-mash of code from other board-makers who are better than me at assembly. If you have any questions, ping me on discord and I'll explain what I've done.<br /></span><br /><br /><span class="bbc_color"><br /><strong>Thanks to:</strong><br />Everyone who has submitted a Mario character model to the SketchUp warehouse. You can easily find the ones I used by searching for "goomba" or "pokey" etc.<br />All the board makers who have made custom events before me. Without looking at and borrowing your code, this board could not have been made.<br />PartyPlanner64 for making such an amazing tool.</span></p>                <button class="btn btn-primary" href="#" data-dismiss="modal">

                <p><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong><span class="bbc_color">&nbsp;Let's try to breathe life into this dying community!<br />It's been a busy couple of weeks, but it's finally finished! A lot of hard work, late nights, and extensive partying--that is, testing, went into this one. Board layout is pretty conventional, but with a fun little gimmick being the skeleton key doors in the center. The player travels around the islands in a clockwise direction (following the arrows on the path; there is no returning once you cross a bridge). However, from the central island, the player can choose to use a skeleton key to jump to the other half of the island, effectively skipping two of the islands. This makes skeleton keys quite coveted in this board. For a better idea, check out the images.&nbsp;<span class="bbc_color">Happening spaces cause Plessie to rise out of the water and carry the player to any other player's location for 10 coins (the player gets to decide if they want to or not). I tried not to add too many happening spaces since they don't do anything at the moment,<br />&nbsp;and I can always add more in the event that they ever come to life.</span>&nbsp;I really hope everyone enjoys it. I've been looking forward to the video review panel ever since I started this project last monday (I discovered it a bit late). I put plenty of references, details and references, so I hope it's a good time. &nbsp;<img class="smiley" title="Cheesy" src="http://mariopartylegacy.com/forum/Smileys/retroclassic/cheesy.gif" alt=":D" /><br />(This board is for the Mario Party board contest #2.<br />Disclaimer: I got most, if not all, of the decorative models used in overtop of the board I sculpted from Sketchup's 3D Warehouse. I did, however, do a bit of texture work (not too much) and arranged all of the models into their current layout.<br />Videos:</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;There are islands surrounding a star, no one knows how the star got there but they know that it has special powers, they found out that the star can be used for fast travel but it takes a sacrifice to get there, 5 golden coins are required to visit the star islands! After a little bit a Koopa figured out he could make a lot of money setting shop up there and so he did. To help visitors out the 2 castles decided to give out coins to anyone that passes their building but 2 Toad's and a Koopa noticed and set up shop near the castles to cash in on the matter. so they also placed some switches around, landing on a switch gives you 10 golden coins as well to help you in your quest. a tower in the area decided to help as well, every time you pass he will give you a random item he has laying around.<br /><br /><strong>Happening Spaces:</strong>&nbsp;The 2 near the switches give you 10 coins, the other once on the board give Mushrooms, Poison Mushrooms or Skeleton Key's<br /><br /><strong>Other Events:</strong>&nbsp;The 2 castles in the top right and bottom left corner give you 10 coins on passing by them and the tower at the top will give you a random item upon visiting them.<br /><br /><strong>Map Goals:</strong>&nbsp;My goal for this map was to make it so that you could go anywhere really quickly while still having a big map, so i decided to take my inspiration from Super Mario World and create the Star Road. This Star Road will bring from 1 of 5 spaces to 1 of 5 spaces faster than you could have done it otherwise without making it luck based. The best once are locked with a Skeleton Key but you can still exit at those positions without the key.<br /><br /><strong>Issues:</strong>&nbsp;One issue with the map is that reverse mushrooms are a bit weird due to the way i designed the map, they can be used and i did my best to make it as clear as possible what way you can go, but sometimes it is a bit confusing. Another issue is that i didn't know that the sides of the board would look a bit weird when you land on it and start rolling a dice again, something i will look out for in my next map.<br /><br /><strong>Final Words:</strong>&nbsp;I hope you guys enjoy my first Mario Party Board and if there is any criteria you guys have about the board than let me know! any tips, tricks, do's and don'ts are welcome! and please enjoy my Board&nbsp;<img class="smiley" title="Laugh" src="http://mariopartylegacy.com/forum/Smileys/retroclassic/laugh.gif" alt=":-D" /></p>                <button class="btn btn-primary" href="#" data-dismiss="modal">
